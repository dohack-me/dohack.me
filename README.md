# dohack.me

A full-stack NextJS app using Supabase and Prisma.

Containers for apps required by challenges are managed by [orchestrator](https://github.com/dohack-me/orchestrator)

this is my first real full-stack project, hopefully the code is not too cursed

i think i made a mistake having each component hit the db for the data it requires but its too late to go back now lmao
